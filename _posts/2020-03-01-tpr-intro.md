title: Tensor Product Representations (TPRs) Literature

Tensor Product Variable Binding is a way to transform the
symbolic structure into the vector format \[1\] using the tensor
product operation.

**Definition 1.** Filler – a particular instance of the given
structural type.
**Definition 2.** Role – a function that filler presents in a
structure.

There are several recent advances in the field that allow
building symbolic and sub-symbolic integrated solutions with
TPRs. The integrated symbolic and sub-symbolic flow
consists of following steps:
• encoding the symbolic structure as a distributed
representation with a neural network. In \[2\] a new
encoder design was proposed for the simple structure
that has only one nesting level.
• flattenning the distributed representation to a vector
format with a neural network \[3\].
• performing domain specific analysis of the structure on
the neural level. For example, identification of whether
the sentence is in Active or Passive voice.
• structural manipulations on the neural level, for
example, joining of two trees in one \[3\].
• decoding the new structure from a distributed
representation to symbolic level.
